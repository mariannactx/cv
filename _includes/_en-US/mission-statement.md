I enjoy changes powered by open and sincere conversations. I believe writing readable and documented code is as important as expensive. I tend to be oriented to answering the user necessities and to respect ESG pratices. I read everything written by Chimamanda Adichie and Octavia Butler and I'm always planning the next trip.
